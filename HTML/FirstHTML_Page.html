    <p>The <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken">chicken</a></b> (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red
        junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs;
        others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.</p>
        <hr>
    <p>Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an
        annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There
        are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.</p>

        <h2> Description </h2>

        <sup>1</sup>/ <sub>2</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/ <sub>2</sub> = 1

    <p> Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds,
        and the wings are short.[18] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow
        them to fly more than a short distance. <sup>[19]</sup>  <br> 
        H<sub>2</sub>O Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[18] Adult chickens
        of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either
        side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males.  Some breeds have a
        mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[20] </p>
    <p> Chickens are gregarious, living in flocks, and incubate eggs and raise young communally. <br> Individual chickens
        dominate others, establishing a pecking order; dominant individuals take priority for access to food and nest
        sites. The concept of dominance, involving pecking, was described in female chickens by Thorleif
        Schjelderup-Ebbe in ,<time datetime="1921">1921</time>  as the "pecking order".[26][27] Male chickens tend to leap and use their claws in
        conflicts.[28] Chickens are capable of mobbing and killing a weak or inexperienced predator, such as a young
        fox.[29] </p>

    <h2> Reproduction and life-cycle </h2>
    <p> To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often lowering
        the wing which is closest to the hen.[32] The dance triggers a response in the hen[32] and when she responds to
        his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in
        which the male approaches the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive, she runs
        off; otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with both feet on her back. After copulation the
        male does a tail-bending display.[33] </p>

        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <h3>Phylogeny</h3>
        <p>Water or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens
            belong to, survived the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds and their
            dinosaur relatives.[43] Chickens are descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are
            scientifically classified as the same species.[44] Domesticated chickens freely interbreed with populations of
            red junglefowl.[44] The domestic chicken has subsequently hybridised with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl
            and green junglefowl;[45] a gene for yellow skin, for instance, was incorporated into domestic birds from the
            grey junglefowl (G. sonneratii).[46] It is estimated that chickens share between 71 and 79% of their genome with
            red junglefowl.[45]</p>
    
        <h3>Domestication</h3>
        <p>According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red junglefowl in present-day Thailand gave
            rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[49] The red junglefowl is well
            adapted to take advantage of the vast quantities of seed produced during the end of the multi-decade bamboo
            seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction.[50] In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of the red
            junglefowl's ability to reproduce prolifically when exposed to a surge in its food supply.[51]</p>
